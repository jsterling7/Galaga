Welcome to Galaga!!!

Here are a few notes about what goes on behind the scenes of this awesome game :)

CONTROLS

LEFT ARROW: move ship left
RIGHT ARROW: move ship right
UP ARROW: shoot
BACKSPACE/DELETE: return to TITLE SCREEN


There are two total levels

	LEVEL 1:
		
	There are only basic aliens. Only the aliens on the front row shoot at the player. Only One alien can shoot at a time. The player must kill all aliens to beat the level.

	LEVEL 2: 
	
	There are basic aliens and attacking aliens. The basic aliens can now shoot three at a time. Once a basic alien is taken out the attacking aliens can charge at the player. Only one attacking alien can charge at a time. Attacking aliens can continue to charge multiple times in a row until they are killed. The player must kill all aliens to beat the level.


How the playerâ€™s score is calculated

	A player gets 10 points for every alien killed. The player also receives 100 points for every life left at the end of the game. 

Other gameplay notes

	The player starts with three lives. When the player is hit by a bullet or a charging alien the player will lose a life and the level will reset (the aliens that have already been killed will remain dead). There is no way to receive new lives throughout the game. If the player dies 4 total times before completing level 2 the game will be over.

FROSTBURN

	The players ship has been upgraded with a new FROSTBURN feature. Whenever the player shoots at the aliens, all incoming alien projectiles will be frozen! The player is still free to move and is even able to move faster during this time. This can provide for some handy escapes! FROSTBURN will end after the players shot leaves the screen. (lasts for about a second or two)
